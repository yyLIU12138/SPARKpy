# SPARKpy

Here is a Python version of the SPARK method, which was developed based on the "Statistical analysis of spatial expression patterns for spatially resolved transcriptomic studies" paper. 

It should be noted that the original SPARK method includes many manual modifications, whereas my implementation largely adheres to the approach described in the original paper with minimal manual modifications. As a result, SPARKpy does not produce the same results as SPARK and should not be used as a substitute for SPARK in formal comparisons in works.
